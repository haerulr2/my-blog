# Getting Started with MDX Blog

This is the very first post on my blog.  
I’m not here to write clickbait tutorials or SEO-optimized guides.  
I’m here to leave **build logs, raw thoughts, and experiments** — exactly the way I want them.

## Why I Chose MDX

Because writing should be simple.  
- Markdown keeps it clean.  
- MDX lets me inject components when I need to.  
- Next.js makes it blazing fast to deploy anywhere.  

No bloated CMS. No overcomplication. Just files, code, and words.

## The Blog’s Mission

This blog isn’t about chasing views.  
It’s about documenting the process:  
- Wins  
- Mistakes  
- Half-baked ideas  
- And the occasional breakdown  

Think of it as a **public workbench** — you’re peeking at whatever I’m building at the moment.

## What’s Coming Next

- More build logs about side projects  
- Experiments with automation and backend infra  
- Notes about frontend frameworks I touch daily  
- Random dev thoughts that don’t fit in Twitter threads
