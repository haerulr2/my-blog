# Building My Dashboard — First Steps

I’ve started working on a **personal dashboard project**.  
Not for a client. Not for a company.  
Just for me — as a playground to test ideas, break things, and add to my portfolio.

## Current Progress

Right now, the dashboard has:  
- A **sidebar** layout to anchor navigation.  
- An **overview page** with my first widget:  
  a **crypto price widget** hitting a public API via Next.js server actions.  

It’s not fancy. But it’s alive.  
And that’s always the hardest part — going from zero to “something works.”

## What’s Next?

The next big piece is the **API Playground page**.  
This will be a space where I can experiment with different endpoints, log requests, and maybe even visualize responses.  

But before I write a single line of code, I need to figure out the **layout**.  
Structure comes first. Execution second.
