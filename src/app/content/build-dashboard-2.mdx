# Dashboard Build Log #2 — Laying Out the Playground

The **Playground page** is finally taking shape.  

---

## Progress

- The **layout is done**.  
- Currently **refactoring styles** so it doesn’t look like a dummy paste job.  
- API integration isn’t wired up yet, but the structure is ready.  

It’s not pretty, but it’s moving forward.  
Consistency matters more than speed.

## Balancing Work & Build

By day I work full-time.  
By night I chip away at this dashboard.  
Sometimes that means progress is measured in **tiny commits** instead of big leaps.  

And that’s okay.  
Momentum beats perfection.
