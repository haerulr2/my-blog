# Deploying with Vercel and Owning My Domain

There’s something different when you see your project live on **your own domain**.  
Not `localhost:3000`, not `randomproject.vercel.app`, but **haerulr2.dev**.  

It’s the moment when a side project becomes real.

## Why Vercel?

Because I want speed, zero-setup deployments, and painless integration with Next.js.  
I push to GitHub → Vercel builds → it’s live.  
No servers to babysit, no CI/CD drama.  

But the real magic isn’t Vercel.  
It’s the domain.

## Owning My Name

Buying `haerulr2.dev` was me saying:  
**“This is mine. This is where my work lives.”**  

It’s not just about branding.  
It’s about control.  
I decide what runs here.  
I decide what goes down.  
No third-party platform owns my identity.  

---

## The Deployment Flow

1. Write code locally.  
2. Push to GitHub.  
3. Vercel auto-builds.  
4. Domain points to the new build.  

That’s it.  
No excuses, no friction.  

---

## Why This Matters

Most devs ship projects but never give them a real home.  
They stay in some `.vercel.app` subdomain or hidden behind `localhost`.  
Owning your domain is like planting a flag on the internet.
