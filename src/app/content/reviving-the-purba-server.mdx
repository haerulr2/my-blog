# Reviving the Purba: Turning an Old Laptop into a Home Server

Every developer has that one forgotten laptop.  
Dusty. Slow. Left to rot in a corner.  
Mine was a Celeron powered relic with 2GB RAM onboard, basically **a fossil**.  

Most people would throw it away.  
I decided to **revive it**.  
Welcome to the story of **si purba**: my resurrected home server.

## Why Even Bother?

Because I like to squeeze value out of “worthless” things.  
And also because a home server gives me:  

- A private playground to deploy APIs  
- A sandbox for automation experiments  
- A space to break things without fear  
- An excuse to tinker with Linux again  

Buying new hardware is easy.  
**Reanimating old hardware is art.**

## The Resurrection

- Installed a lightweight Linux distro (Debian minimal).  
- Gave it a new SSD transplant (RIP the ancient HDD).  
- Set up SSH access, firewall, and static IP.  
- Connected it to Cloudflare Tunnel so I can expose services without exposing my real IP.  

Suddenly, the **slow junker became a breathing server**.

## What It Runs Now

- **APIs** for experiments (Node.js, Express, anything I want)  
- **n8n** automation flows (coming soon)  
- **Personal blog backend playground**  
- Background daemons that survive reboots  

Basically, si purba now pulls its weight again.

## Lessons Learned

- Old machines can still teach you new tricks  
- Constraints force you to be creative  
- Self-hosting makes you feel closer to the machine

⚡ Brutalist Note

> Most people see trash.  
> I see infrastructure.  
> Si purba is slow, noisy, and fragile. But it’s mine.  
> And in a world obsessed with shiny new tech, reviving old hardware feels like rebellion.
