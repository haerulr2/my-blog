# Automation Playground: Running n8n on My Home Server

The **purba** lives on.  
After turning my old Celeron laptop into a home server, I decided to give it a new job:  
becoming an **automation playground** with [n8n](https://n8n.io).  

---

## Why n8n?

Because clicking the same buttons every day is slavery.  
Automation is liberation.  
n8n is open-source, self-hosted, and flexible enough to run on my dinosaur hardware.  

I don’t want to rely on SaaS for everything.  
I want my own workflows, on my own metal, under my own domain.  

---

## The Setup

- **Hardware**: my resurrected laptop purba (2GB RAM, Debian minimal).  
- **Runtime**: Docker container running n8n.  
- **Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel, exposing n8n through a custom domain.  

Now, my n8n instance is **publicly accessible** through a URL I own, no port forwarding, no ISP headaches.  

---

## First Experiments

I started small:  
- Basic test flows just to explore n8n’s interface.  
- Chaining simple triggers and actions.  
- Playing around with APIs.  

Nothing fancy yet, but the point is, **the pipeline is alive**.  
The purba can now automate.  

---

## Why This Matters

This is more than running another web app.  
This is about:  

- **Owning my automation stack**  
- **Learning how to orchestrate workflows**  
- **Proving old hardware can still add value**  

And of course, building the foundation for bigger experiments:  
from auto-posting logs, to scraping, to gluing APIs together.
